							"I don't know what I would have done if I had not found Hugo and  Colores Painting Company.

							We had major interior wall issues - and needed to make the house look perfect to put on the market. Hugo worked with me on our tight budget. He and his crew were always on time, did amazing work and solved problems as they came up. He is a perfectionist, super-organized and trustworthy. They work clean and have been wonderful to work with. The house looks fantastic. You'd be crazy not to use them."

							“While Hugo has done exceptional work in all facets of building and remodels, his specialty, painting, is his true art... Hugo is more than just someone who knows how to give brush strokes, he is your ally when you're interested in getting the most of a paint project, and then some. Wherever there are issues to contend with:  special paint, special matching, historic buildings, new construction, etc., you can be sure that Hugo and his capable team are on the money. Thanks Hugo, and it is with pleasure that I submit this recommendation."

							“Hugo did a outstanding job painting the interior of our 12-unit condo complex. There was an incredible amount of detail work involved in the project, and he handled it beautifully. He also did an excellent job painting the interior of our home in Cupertino. His expertise goes beyond painting. He's more of a general contractor. His customer service is amazing. His priority is to ensure that his clients are pleased with his work. His pricing is extremely competitive. I would highly recommend Hugo, and plan to use his services again for another major job shortly.”

							"We've been working with Hugo for about 3 years now. Framing, paint, plumbing, commercial work and office. He does it all. Hands down the best bid price and quickest delivery of work completion. Makes everyone else look bad. Hugo and his crew are fast, clean and efficient."

							“Hugo does excellent painting and general contract work. His company, Colores Painting, has run ads with our paper, the SF Advertiser, for years with a positive response from our readers. I would definitely recommend Hugo for large residential and commercial projects whether exterior painting, remodeling, or construction.”

							"I highly recommend Hugo Ruiz. Hugo and The Colores Painting Company have provided consistently outstanding service when they painted the exterior of my two properties and done extensive deck and other work. Because Hugo is a general contractor, he can address any issue that may arise, and, in my case, has done so with care and excellent work."
